- Fix primary takeover printing whole history of elev state updates
- Split Brain Problem
-- Include Time stamp on worldView
-- Include Primary ID in worldView
--- Primary Election algorithm


Thoughts about the Split Brain Problem:
- There can only be one primary at a time
- Primary takover must happen fast

Scenario 1:
- Primary is gone for a short period
- Multiple backups tries to takeover
-- backup with latest update takes over
--- backup with lowest ID takes over
- Previous Primary gets back online
-- Is noticed that a new primary has taken over
--- Revert to backup mode

Scenario 2:
- A backup becomes offline
-- Receives no heartbeats
--- It is the only one on its network
---- Starts its own primary and broadcasts its worldView
- Is connected back online
-- Receives messages from the primary of the other network
--- Two primaries on the network!! Which one gets to stay?

Questions for TAs:
- Do we need to make the code runnable on any system (is this even possible), or is it fine to use OS-specific commands?
- Is there an upper limit on number of threads being used? Does it matter if most threads are default in a blocking state?
- How would you solve the naming of global constants? LARGE_LETTERS or another format?
- Dot-importing the config file. Yes or No?
